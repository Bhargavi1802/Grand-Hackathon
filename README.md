# Hackathon - Heart Rate Prediction 

The hackathon data comprises various attributes taken from signals measured using ECG recorded for different individuals having different heart rates at the time the measurement was taken. These various features contribute to the heart rate at the given instant of time for the individual.

The objective is to build a regressor model which can predict the heart rate of an individual. This prediction can help to monitor stress levels of the individual.
